Today, I watched *Bottle Radha*, a movie that made me reflect on addiction and self-control...

Reflection After Watching Bottle Radha
I chose to stay back during spring break while Tejaswini left for a tour. In this time of solitude, I watched Bottle Radha, a Tamil film that explores alcoholism and its consequences on the protagonist, his family, and his surroundings. The film made me realize that addiction—whether to alcohol, food, or any indulgence—can disrupt not only one’s personal goals but also relationships and overall well-being.

What struck me the most was how I saw myself in the protagonist, not in terms of alcohol, but in my relationship with food. I indulged in food while watching the movie, eating just for the sake of it. This is something I have been aware of for a while. Even back in Japan, when I was at my fittest, this pattern emerged, and Tejaswini noticed it. She was disappointed, and rightly so—because this habit is not just a small indulgence; it’s a barrier to the vision I have for myself.

I’ve experienced firsthand the negative effects of this behavior. It affects my physical health, my discipline, and even my mental clarity. More importantly, it affects my relationship. Living with a partner means that my habits are not just mine—they are observed, reflected upon, and can influence the dynamics of our life together. If I don’t change this, it will inevitably have an impact on my future, my goals, and my family life.

The movie conveyed a strong message: an addict cannot bargain with their addiction. Saying, “I will drink in moderation” doesn’t work; the only way out is complete abstinence. This made me realize that I cannot negotiate with my indulgence in food either. I can’t say, I will control it sometimes. Instead, I need a strict, structured approach—just like an alcoholic choosing sobriety.

Commitment Moving Forward
I need to treat this with seriousness and commit to a structured lifestyle for at least five years. This isn’t just about weight control; it’s about breaking a pattern that could hinder my long-term well-being. My goal is to be highly conscious of what I consume, stick to my calorie limits, and develop a disciplined approach to food—just as I would with any other life goal.

By doing this, I am not just working toward a healthier body, but also a stronger mindset, a more disciplined life, and a future where I can be proud of my choices. This will not only make my life better but will also positively impact my relationship with my partner and my overall vision for my career and personal growth.

This reflection is a promise to my future self: I hope that five years from now, I look back at this moment as a turning point and not as another instance where I recognized the problem but failed to act.
